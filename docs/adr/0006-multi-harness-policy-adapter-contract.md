# 6. Multi-Harness Policy Adapter Contract and Trusted Context

**Status**: `accepted` (Extends ADR 0004)  
**Date**: `2026-08-25`

## Context
ADR 0004 established vertical adapter slices for agent harnesses. However, the initial implementation allowed untrusted caller payloads to pass authority-defining parameters directly into gatekeeper logic, used flat dictionaries with nullable fields, and failed open on corrupted input streams.

## Decision
1. **Explicit Separation of Request vs Trusted Context**:
   The policy evaluation contract is strictly defined in `wit/gauntlet_policy.wit` and Rust as:
   ```rust
   pub fn evaluate(
       req: &CapabilityRequest,
       ctx: &EnforcementContext,
   ) -> PolicyDecision
   ```
   - `CapabilityRequest` contains typed action types (`ReadFile`, `WriteFile`, `ExecuteCommand`, `Other`), raw tool name, target resource, and raw payload JSON.
   - `EnforcementContext` is constructed exclusively by `xGauntlet` from trusted runtime inspection (resolved canonical workspace path, active task status discovered from `tasks/`, and read-only flags). Adapters cannot override context parameters from raw tool arguments.

2. **Harness-Specific Fail-Closed Enforcement**:
   All adapter entrypoints and hook parsers MUST fail closed according to their platform's specific hook contract:
   - For Google Antigravity: Emit stdout `{"decision": "deny", "reason": "..."}` AND return exit code 1.
   - For Claude Code & OpenAI Codex: Return exit code 1 with structured rejection message.
   - Corrupted, empty, or unparseable input streams fail closed immediately.

3. **Zero Cryptographic Authority**:
   Adapters are strictly transport-layer translators. They MUST NOT manage cryptographic keys, issue signatures, or alter verification reports.

4. **Shared Conformance Test Suite**:
   Every harness adapter must pass a parameterized conformance test suite validating typed request translation, fail-closed handling of malformed payloads, and immutability of the trusted context.

## Consequences
- Prevents malicious or confused-deputy agents from bypassing path or command restrictions by manipulating hook payloads.
- Ensures all harness implementations adhere to identical security invariants.
